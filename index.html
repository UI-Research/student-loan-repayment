        <p>
		To help make student loan repayment affordable, the US Department of Education offers several repayment plans that set monthly payments based on the borrower’s income. These plans require borrowers to pay a portion of their discretionary income (earnings above 150 percent of the federal poverty level) for a given number of years, after which the remainder of the loan is forgiven. 
		</p>
		<p>
		As Congress faces the task of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, proposals to change these income-driven repayment plans abound. Introduced late last year, the House’s PROSPER (or Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform) Act suggested one new version of income-driven repayment, and it’s likely the Senate will suggest another. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The parameters of a repayment plan—the percentage of income paid, the period of repayment, and requirements for minimum payments—can substantially affect how much borrowers pay toward their loans. This tool shows how these parameters will affect the amount borrowers will pay (in present dollars) and how long it will take for borrowers to pay off the loan.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can build your own policy by changing parameters, or use the buttons to model existing repayment plans or proposals. By adjusting the loan amount, you can see what would be repaid (and for how long) for borrowers at different starting income levels.
		</p>
		<p>
		The chart on the left shows how much borrowers would repay based on their starting income. The chart to the right models how long borrowers would be in repayment, again based on their income. We’ve also calculated how much borrowers would repay under a standard 10-year plan to show how an income-driven plan compares with the standard repayment option.  
		</p>
		<p>
		The Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan for undergraduates requires borrowers pay 10 percent of their discretionary income, with the remainder of the loan forgiven after 20 years. Because the loans continue to accrue interest, it is possible that some borrowers will pay more than they would have under a standard 10-year plan. Borrowers who make less than 150 percent of the poverty level pay nothing ($0) on their loans. Dependent undergraduate students can borrow a maximum of $31,000 in federal student loans. 
		</p>
		<p>
		REPAYE for graduate students is the same as REPAYE for undergraduates, except that the period before forgiveness is extended to 25 years. Graduate students can borrow a maximum of $138,500 in federal student loans.
		<p>
		Under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF), borrowers on an income-driven repayment plan, such as REPAYE, who work in a nonprofit or public-sector job for 10 years are eligible for student loan forgiveness. This benefit is available to those with either undergraduate and graduate student loans.
		</p>
    <p>
    The House’s PROSPER plan would require students to pay 15 percent of their discretionary income. Borrowers would have to make a minimum monthly payment of $25 dollars (which can be reduced to $5 due to severe economic hardship). And there is no loan forgiveness, but payments end when borrowers have paid what they would have under a standard 10-year plan, meaning that borrowers do not pay for additional accrued interest. The lack of a loan forgiveness period means that some borrowers might be paying off their loans for the entirety of their careers.

                      We measured the progressivity of school funding as the difference between two weighted averages of each district&rsquo;s per-student revenue: (1) weights are the number of poor students; and (2) weights are the number of nonpoor students. For example, an estimate of $100 would imply that, on average, poor students attend districts that receive $100 more in per-student funding than the districts nonpoor students attend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We calculated our measure for nearly all regular US school districts using data on federal, state, and local revenues from the US Department of Education&rsquo;s Common Core of Data Local Education Agency Finance Survey (F-33). We merged the finance data with district-level poverty data from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Model-based Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates.  We adjusted districts&rsquo; funding amounts for differences in the costs they face using a measure of the salaries of college graduates who are not teachers in the district&rsquo;s labor market.
